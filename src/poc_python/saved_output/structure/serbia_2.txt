Note that I did not include "See also" as it is not a main topic, but rather an additional information section.
Also note that some topics were nested under others (e.g., 3.c Revolution and independence). This reflects how these sections are organized in the original text.
The output does not contain any numerical references or dates. It only lists the main topic names with possible subtopics as necessary to reflect their hierarchical structure within the original text.
I hope this meets
